## About App Author

My name is Mykola Kanunnikov (or Nick Eve in the English manner). I'm a beginning developer from Odesa, Ukraine.

I chose this project for two reasons: 
1. I need portfolio to land a job;
2. I realize how much money could be saved by proper container packing.

You can follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mykola-kanunnikov-96b348246/). Here I also make posts about this project.

## Checklist Instructions

Complete the checklist for each container to be packed. If ANY of the answers are “NO”, stop packing, alert your
supervisor. DO NOT dispatch the container.
* The app contains reference documents alongside each checklist item. There are 28 pdf help files.
